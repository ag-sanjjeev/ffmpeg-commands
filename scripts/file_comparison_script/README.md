# File Comparison Script

This script will compare and generate report text file between different directories containing same file name with different in their properties. 

## &#9873; Consider Following Steps:

1. Inspect the code completely.
2. Update `dir1` and `dir2` in the code.
3. `dir1` is the directory, which must contain media files.
4. `dir2` is the directory, where the media files with same name and differs in their properties.
5. It compares between `dir1` files with `dir2` files.
6. It will ignore comparison when file name does not match on both directories.
6. This will suitable for the directory structure as `dir1 => subfolders ... => files ...`.
7. The `dir1` might has number of `subfolders` and each of the `subfolders` might has media files that need to be compared with `dir2` which has same directory structure as `dir1`.
8. This script will iterate through all files inside `subfolders` in the specified `dir1`.
9. If your `dir1` and `dir2` has different folder structure, then adjust the execution logic at your own risk.
10. Make sure `dir1` and `dir2` has same folder structure.
11. Look for alternative commands provide inside the script, if the output is not desired format.
12. After completion of the comparison. It will wait for user input. That you have to press any key to close the script after completion.
13. To skip/stop conversion for the current conversion file, It might required shortcut prescribed for the `windows cmd` tool in your keyboard to be pressed during execution.

## &#9873; Disclaimer

This is a repository contains few of the commands to compare files between two directories contains same folder structure and file names except their properties such as size, author, date modified and so on. That can be useful for compare convert media files in your computer/device. Be caution, the author shall not be responsible for any warranty or claim to any malfunctions or lose arise from these commands and scripts. Make a backup your files before proceed.
